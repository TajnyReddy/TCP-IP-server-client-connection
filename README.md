# Simple TCP-IP Chat Application
This is a simple client-server chat application implemented in Python using socket programming and threading. It allows multiple clients to connect to a server and exchange messages.
### Usage
1. First, start the server by running server.py.
2. Then, run the client script klient.py.
3. You can run multiple instances of the client script to simulate multiple clients.
4. Once the client connects to the server, you can start sending messages. Each message sent by a client will be received by all other connected clients.
